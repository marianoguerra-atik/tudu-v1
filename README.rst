tudu
====

An example project that builds an end to end todo list using
clojure/immutant on the backend and clojurescript/om.next on the frontend

Setup
-----

First you need `leiningen <http://leiningen.org/>`_ installed and running,
follow the link for installation instructions.

We need a local version of om.next installed since it's still in alpha, we
will use alpha30 to start with, we may upgrade it later in the development.

To make it easy just run once, it will install the required version of om.next locally for you::

    make setup
